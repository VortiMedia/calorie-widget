# Calorie Calculation Formulas

## Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)

### Mifflin-St Jeor Equation
- For men: BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age in years) + 5
- For women: BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age in years) - 161

## Activity Multipliers
- Sedentary (little or no exercise): BMR × 1.2
- Lightly active (1-3 days/week): BMR × 1.375
- Moderately active (3-5 days/week): BMR × 1.55
- Very active (6-7 days/week): BMR × 1.725
- Extra active (physical job/training): BMR × 1.9

## Calorie Targets
- Weight loss (moderate): TDEE - 500 calories
- Weight loss (aggressive): TDEE - 1000 calories
- Weight maintenance: TDEE
- Weight gain (moderate): TDEE + 500 calories
- Weight gain (aggressive): TDEE + 1000 calories
